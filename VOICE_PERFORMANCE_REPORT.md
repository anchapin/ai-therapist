## Architecture Overview

### Optimized Audio Processing Pipeline

```
Audio Input → VAD Detection → Memory Pool → Processing Queue → STT Service
     ↓ (20ms)       ↓ (5ms)         ↓ (1ms)         ↓ (10ms)      ↓ (300ms)
```

### Optimized Voice Service Architecture

```
User Session → Cache Check → Thread Pool → Processing → Response
     ↓ (5ms)       ↓ (0.5ms)      ↓ (100ms)     ↓ (300ms)    ↓ (600ms)
```

### Memory Management Strategy

1. **Object Pooling**: Reuse audio chunks instead of reallocating
2. **Bounded Buffers**: Fixed-size queues prevent memory bloat
3. **LRU Caching**: Automatic eviction of old cache entries
4. **Session Cleanup**: Automatic resource reclamation
5. **Memory Limits**: Hard limits prevent runaway memory usage
