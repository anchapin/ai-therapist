# Coverage Measurement System Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `tests/test_runner.py`
**Changed coverage scope from single module to all first-party modules:**

- **Before**: `--cov=voice` (only measured voice module)
- **After**: `--cov=voice --cov=security --cov=auth --cov=performance --cov=database`

**Added coverage reporting improvements:**
- `--cov-report=term-missing:skip-covered` - Shows only uncovered lines in terminal output
- `--cov-fail-under=90` - Enforces 90% coverage threshold (will fail tests if below)

### 2. Replaced `ci_test_runner.py`
**Before**: Hardcoded stub returning fake 19% coverage
**After**: Delegates to the real `tests/test_runner.py`

The new CI test runner is a simple wrapper:
```python
from tests.test_runner import main
sys.exit(main())
```

## Actual Coverage Results

**Total Coverage: 26.8%**
- Total Lines: 9,938
- Covered Lines: 2,660
- Missing Lines: 7,278

### Coverage by Module:
- **voice/**: ~14-60% (varies by file)
- **security/**: ~20-29%
- **auth/**: ~27-34%
- **performance/**: ~22-45%
- **database/**: (included in measurement)

## Impact

1. ✅ **Accurate measurement**: Now measuring all first-party code, not just voice/
2. ✅ **CI consistency**: ci_test_runner.py now uses real test runner instead of fake data
3. ✅ **Better visibility**: `skip-covered` option shows only what needs attention
4. ✅ **Quality gate**: `--cov-fail-under=90` enforces coverage threshold

## Next Steps

The actual coverage (26.8%) is well below the 90% target. To improve:
1. Add tests for uncovered code in all modules
2. Focus on low-coverage files (voice/voice_service.py at 14%, voice/voice_ui.py at 19%)
3. Ensure all new code includes tests before merging
