# Audio Processing Settings
AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE=16000
AUDIO_CHANNELS=1
AUDIO_CHUNK_SIZE=1024

# STT Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_WHISPER_MODEL=whisper-1

# TTS Services
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
OPENAI_TTS_MODEL=tts-1

# Voice Commands
VOICE_COMMAND_WAKE_WORD="therapist"
VOICE_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=5000

# Security & Privacy
VOICE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true
VOICE_CONSENT_REQUIRED=true
VOICE_PRIVACY_MODE=true
```
