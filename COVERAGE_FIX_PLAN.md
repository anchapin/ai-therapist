# Code Coverage Fix Plan - Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive plan to fix code coverage issues identified through Oracle review. Current coverage: **27%** (up from fake 19%), with clear path to 90%+.

## Key Problem Identified

The project was reporting **fake 19% coverage** from a hardcoded stub (`ci_test_runner.py`) instead of actual test results. The real test runner only measured `voice/` package, ignoring extensive tests in `security/`, `auth/`, `performance/`, and `database/`.

## Implementation Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Fix Coverage Measurement Infrastructure (Tasks 1-3)

1. **Updated tests/test_runner.py**
   - Changed coverage scope from `--cov=voice` to `--cov=voice --cov=security --cov=auth --cov=performance --cov=database`
   - Added `--cov-report=term-missing:skip-covered` for better visibility
   - Added `--cov-fail-under=90` to enforce threshold
   - **Impact**: Now measuring 9,938 statements across all modules (up from ~716)

2. **Fixed ci_test_runner.py**
   - Removed hardcoded 19% fake coverage
   - Now delegates to real test_runner.py
   - **Impact**: CI gets actual coverage data

3. **Fixed voice/voice_ui.py import guard**
   - Changed from hard import-time failure to soft fallback
   - Module now imports successfully without Streamlit/NumPy
   - **Impact**: Tests can run in headless CI and contribute to coverage

### ✅ Phase 2: Add Missing Tests (Tasks 4-7)

4. **VoiceService Tests** - 24 new tests
   - `add_conversation_entry` coverage (old/new conventions, invalid args)
   - `update_voice_settings` parameter orders
   - `health_check` degradation paths
   - Queue handlers (_handle_start_session, _handle_stop_session, etc.)

5. **STTService Tests** - 22 new tests
   - `_get_provider_fallback_chain` behavior
   - `_calculate_audio_quality_score` edge cases (empty, NaN, inf, clipping)
   - `set_language`/`set_model` validation
   - `batch_transcribe` mixed success/error cases
   - Service info methods

6. **TTSService Tests** - 30 new tests
   - `build_ssml` options and tag validation
   - Caching (`_get_cache_key`, `_cache_result` LRU eviction)
   - `save_audio` error paths
   - `get_supported_*` methods with unavailable providers

7. **voice/config.py Tests** - 22 new tests
   - `update_config` type validation and nested key routing
   - `backup`/`restore` roundtrip
   - `generate_diff`, `is_compatible_with_version`
   - `generate_template` variants
   - `load_for_environment`

### ✅ Total New Tests Added: **98 tests**

## Current Status

- **Coverage**: 27% (2,660/9,938 lines)
- **Tests**: All new tests passing
- **Modules measured**: voice, security, auth, performance, database

| voice/voice_service.py | 844 | 729 | 14% |

## Path to 90% Coverage

### High-Impact Next Steps

1. **Run existing security/auth tests** (likely to add 20-30% coverage)
   - Security module tests exist but may need runner config tweaks
   - Auth tests exist and comprehensive

2. **Add integration tests** for main workflows
   - Complete voice conversation flow
   - Auth + PII protection integration
   - End-to-end therapy session

3. **Focus on low-hanging fruit**:
   - Error handling branches
   - Validation logic
   - Configuration helpers
   - Service info/repr methods

4. **Voice module improvements**:
   - `voice/voice_service.py` (14% → target 80%): worker loop, state transitions
   - `voice/voice_ui.py` (19% → target 70%): UI components with mocks
   - `voice/security.py` (20% → target 80%): security flows
   - `voice/audio_processor.py` (23% → target 70%): processing pipeline

## Estimated Effort to 90%

- **Immediate wins**: Running existing tests properly: +20-30% (0.5 hours)
- **Integration tests**: +15-20% (2-3 hours)
- **Voice module gaps**: +15-20% (3-4 hours)
- **Final edge cases**: +5-10% (2-3 hours)

**Total estimated**: 8-11 hours to reach 90%+

## Next Actions

2. Run full test suite to get accurate baseline coverage
3. Implement high-impact next steps listed above
4. Monitor coverage progress toward 90% target

## Oracle Recommendations Applied

✅ Fixed CI measurement (removed fake 19% stub)
✅ Broadened coverage scope to all modules
✅ Fixed voice_ui import guard
✅ Added missing VoiceService tests
✅ Added missing STTService tests
✅ Added missing TTSService tests
✅ Added missing config.py tests

## Conclusion

The foundation is now solid. The fake coverage reporting has been eliminated, measurement infrastructure is correct, and 98 new high-quality tests have been added. With existing security/auth tests properly counted and the next round of integration tests, 90%+ coverage is achievable.
