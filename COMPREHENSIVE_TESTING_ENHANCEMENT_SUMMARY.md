- **Real-time Visualization**: Waveform display, frequency spectrum, volume meters, performance optimization
- **Emergency Protocol UI**: Crisis alert display, emergency contacts, session logging
- **Error Handling**: Microphone permissions, audio device fallbacks, network connectivity, rate limiting
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Web Audio API, media stream permissions
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, debounced inputs, memory cleanup

### Key Features:
- 26 comprehensive test methods
- Async support for real-time operations
- Mock-based testing for Streamlit components
- Performance benchmarking (60fps visualization testing)
- Accessibility validation (WCAG AA compliance)

## 2. HIPAA Compliance Testing (`tests/security/test_hipaa_comprehensive.py`)

### Coverage Areas:

### Key Features:
- 6 major test classes with 25+ test methods
- Real PHI detection scenarios
- Encryption validation
- Audit trail verification
- Multi-factor authentication testing
- 6-year retention policy validation

## 3. Performance Stress Testing (`tests/performance/test_performance_stress_testing.py`)

### Coverage Areas:
- **Memory Pressure**: Leak detection, cleanup under pressure, concurrent allocation, fragmentation
- **Cache Performance**: Eviction under load, TTL expiration, thread safety, performance metrics
- **Concurrent Testing**: Voice processing, thread pool management, async resource cleanup
- **Alert Systems**: Memory thresholds, performance degradation, cooldown periods, load testing
- **Regression Detection**: Baseline capture, trend analysis, continuous monitoring

### Key Features:
- Memory leak detection with tracemalloc
- Concurrent load testing with asyncio
- Cache eviction scenarios
- Performance regression analysis
- Alert system reliability testing
- Memory fragmentation detection

## 4. Integration Testing (`tests/integration/test_voice_auth_security_integration.py`)

### Coverage Areas:
- **Voice-Auth Integration**: Authentication flow, role-based access, session security, concurrent sessions
- **Voice-Security Integration**: Real-time PHI filtering, data encryption, crisis detection, audit trails
- **Performance Integration**: Memory management, concurrent processing, resource cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Auth failures, service failover, breach response, graceful degradation

### Key Features:
- End-to-end integration workflows
- Session management across components
- Security boundary testing
- Performance optimization validation
- Error recovery scenarios

## 5. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

### Fixtures and Utilities:
- **Isolated Test Environments**: Function-scoped fixtures for complete isolation
- **Mock Services**: Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
- **Test Data Generation**: Realistic test data for various scenarios
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in performance tracking and validation

## Testing Statistics

### Total Test Coverage Enhancement:

python3 -m pytest tests/performance/test_performance_stress_testing.py -v
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_voice_auth_security_integration.py -v

# Run with coverage
python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=voice --cov=security --cov=performance --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test categories
python3 -m pytest tests/ui/ -v -k "mobile_responsiveness"
python3 -m pytest tests/security/ -v -k "phi_detection"
python3 -m pytest tests/performance/ -v -k "memory_pressure"
