3. **API Key Requirements**: Tests use mocked services
4. **Permission Issues**: Ensure test directory access

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
pytest tests/unit/ -v -s

# Run specific test with debugging
pytest tests/unit/test_audio_processor.py::TestAudioProcessor::test_initialization -v -s

# Check coverage for specific file
coverage report --show-missing voice/audio_processor.py
```

## üìù Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Voice Features Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
