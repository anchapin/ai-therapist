## Features

- **Local & Private**: Runs entirely on your local machine using Ollama, ensuring your conversations remain private and confidential.
- **🎤 Voice Interaction**: Full voice conversation capabilities with multiple provider support and automatic fallbacks
- **Evidence-Based**: Responses are grounded in a knowledge base of therapeutic documents (e.g., articles on anxiety, CBT worksheets).
- **Conversational Memory**: Remembers the context of your conversation for a more natural and coherent interaction.
- **Source-Citing**: Can cite the source documents it used to generate a response.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple, intuitive chat interface powered by Streamlit.
- **🔒 HIPAA-Compliant**: Voice data encryption, privacy controls, and consent management.

## Architecture Overview

The project is composed of several key components:

- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application. It handles the user interface, chat logic, and on-the-fly creation of the vector store if it doesn't exist.
- **`download_knowledge.py`**: A utility script to download the PDF and TXT files that form the knowledge base. It reads a list of URLs from `knowledge_files.txt`.
- **`build_vectorstore.py`**: A script to manually build the vector store using OpenAI embeddings. This is an alternative to the in-app process, which uses local Ollama embeddings.
- **`test_ollama.py`**: A simple script to verify that the connection to the Ollama server is working correctly for both embeddings and chat models.
- **`knowledge/`**: This directory stores the source documents (PDFs, TXTs) that the AI uses as its knowledge base.
- **`vectorstore/`**: This directory holds the FAISS index, which is the vectorized representation of the knowledge base.
- **`.env`**: The environment file for configuring paths and API keys.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Ollama**: You must have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running.
- **Ollama Models**: Pull the required models by running:
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3.2:latest
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
  ```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file by copying the template:

```bash
cp template.env .env
```

**Required for basic functionality:**
